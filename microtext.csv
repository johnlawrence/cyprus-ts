RA,so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed.,"However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed,"
RA,That's why causing such obstacles must to be more urgently punished.,This results in a lack of alertness in the road traffic comparable to a minor offense of the traffic regulations.

CA,The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine.,"Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself,"
RA,"Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,",One reason for this is that they have thus far hardly had to fear the consequences despite the obligation to clean up.

RA,Actually it would be justified if all German universities charged tuition fees.,"As long as it is ensured that the funds really benefit the universities directly, one can continue to regard this as social justice."

RA,It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest.,"Furthermore, there's no need to keep shops open on Sundays."
CA,"Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste,",but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense.

CA,dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate.,The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don't do damage to others.
RA,so there's no advantage for the current paying viewers of the public broadcasters.,"By now you have advertising on all channels,"
CA,Current regulations for the calculation of the total grade should therefore be maintained.,Indeed the preparation of such a scientific work is a fundamental competency that must be acquired in philological degrees.

RA,The statutory health insurance companies should also cover treatments with non-medical and alternative practitioners.,which ultimately also saves costs for conventional treatments and medication.

CA,the statutory retirement age should in the future not remain at 63 years.,"and physical and psychological wear on personnel is steadily increasing,"
RA,"The developments in that conflict should not be left to former Cold War opponents alone,",for that course can only lead to escalation in some form.
RA,but the German services evidently do collaborate with them closely.,"Their tools, data and expertise have been used to keep us under surveillance for a long time."
CA,It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.,That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits).
RA,"If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements, there would presumably be less dog dirt,",which in turn would result in generally clean pavements.

RA,Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany.,Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone.
RA,Particularly the younger generations are no longer dependent on the programming of public broadcasters.,and online magazines are turned to instead of the “Tagesthemen”.

RA,Berlin's basketball team has just come out of a sobering season.,Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations.
RA,For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong.,I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades.
RA,"so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea.","For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin,"

RA,With those kinds of amounts you think twice about whether you really want to stay in the flat.,"If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises."

RA,A reduction in the amount of chemically produced medication per person is most certainly desirable.,"From time immemorial humans have had complementary medicine,"
RA,"No, the retirement age should be raised to 65 again.",Without them we'd forgo a great deal of collected experience.
RA,It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team.,But the worst thing is his habit of always complaining to the referee.
RA,"Especially now, as there is a lack of skilled labour, it's irresponsible for the economy and prosperity to retire at 63.","Also, one isn't taking responsibility for society if one gives up one's experienced, healthy and highly qualified capabilities earlier than necessary for private/personal reasons."

RA,Today I will delete my Facebook account.,Not only because I'm constantly astonished about who wants to be my friend.

RA,In a few decades our society will have a disproportionate number of old people:,and at the same time birth rates are declining.
RA,The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor's decision for natural treatment and also to cover it.,Such therapies can frequently result in an improvement in the condition through the active participation of the patient.
RA,"Besides it should be in the interest of the health insurers to recognize alternative medicine as treatment,",since there is a chance of recovery.
CA,For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.,Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment.

RA,That's why Germany should not introduce capital punishment!,A door must remain open for making amends.

RA,"Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,",Besides you're not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment.
RA,A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences.,"Besides, a higher degree of luxury (expensive flats) is not necessary for the majority of the people, but rather a flat at all."
RA,"Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends.",and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren't open when I'm off work?
